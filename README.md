 🛠️ Core Systems

- 🧠 Modular Wave Spawner  
  - Progressive enemy spawns with scaling difficulty and boss waves every few rounds.
  - Fully configurable wave and boss logic.

- 👹 Boss Encounters  
  - Modular boss system: each boss can have unique second-phase mechanics, camera shake, minion spawns, and more.
  - Bosses become more dangerous as their HP drops.

- 💰 Shop & Currency System  
  - Spend coins or gems between waves to:
    - Upgrade weapons
    - Buy modular passives (damage, survivability, income, special effects)
    - Watch rewarded ads for premium items (WIP)

- ⚡ Upgrade Panel  
  - After each wave, choose from powerful stat upgrades, with probabilities influenced by your luck stat.

- 📦 Modular Passive System  
  - Add or remove any stat (damage, crit, armor, etc.) via a single, clean Inspector interface.
  - Special passives: Momentum, Glass Cannon, Static Field, Retaliation, Unstoppable, and more.
  - All passives are type-safe, self-documenting, and easy to extend.

- 💎 Currency & Monetization  
  - Coins from enemies, gems from ads or rewards.
  - AdMob rewarded ads for premium shop purchases (WIP).

- 🔥 100+ Waves  
  - Each wave is more intense, riskier, and packed with stronger enemies and bosses.

- 🛡️ Interactivity  
  - Modern UI/UX, floating damage text, health bars, and beautiful shaders.
  - All scripts use type hints, comments, and Godot best practices.
