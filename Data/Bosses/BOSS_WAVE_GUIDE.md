## Tips for Players

1. **Wave 5 (First Boss)**: The Swarm Lord is the easiest boss. Focus on clearing minions first.
2. **Wave 10**: The Shadow teleports - keep moving and don't stand still.
3. **Wave 15**: The Guardian's shields rotate - time your attacks between shield passes.
4. **Wave 20**: The Berserker gets stronger as it loses health - finish it quickly!
5. **Wave 25+**: Bosses become progressively harder. Make sure to upgrade your weapons and stats.

## Boss HP Scaling

Boss base HP scales with wave number:
- Base HP = 10 + (wave_number × 6)
- Example: Wave 5 boss has 10 + (5 × 6) = 40 base HP
- Example: Wave 25 boss has 10 + (25 × 6) = 160 base HP

Second phase HP is fixed per boss type (doesn't scale with wave).

Good luck, and may you survive all 20 boss waves! 🎮
